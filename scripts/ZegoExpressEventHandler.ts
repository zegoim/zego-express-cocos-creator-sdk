   * Description: Callback notification of audio/video engine status update. When audio/video functions are enabled, such as preview, push streaming, local media player, audio data observering, etc., the audio/video engine will enter the start state. When you exit the room or disable all audio/video functions , The audio/video engine will enter the stop state.
   * Trigger: The developer called the relevant function to change the state of the audio and video engine. For example: 1. Called ZegoExpressEngine's [startPreview], [stopPreview], [startPublishingStream], [stopPublishingStream], [startPlayingStream], [stopPlayingStream], [startAudioDataObserver], [stopAudioDataObserver] and other functions. 2. The related functions of MediaPlayer are called. 3. The [LogoutRoom] function was called. 4. The related functions of RealTimeSequentialDataManager are called.
   * Restrictions: None.
   * Caution:
   *   1. When the developer calls [destroyEngine], this notification will not be triggered because the resources of the SDK are completely released.
   *   2. If there is no special need, the developer does not need to pay attention to this callback.
   *
   * @param state The audio/video engine state.

   * Use cases: Developers can use this callback to determine the status of the current user in the room.
   * When to trigger:
   *  1. The developer will receive this notification when calling the [loginRoom], [logoutRoom], [switchRoom] functions.
   *  2. This notification may also be received when the network condition of the user's device changes (SDK will automatically log in to the room when disconnected, please refer to [Does ZEGO SDK support a fast reconnection for temporary disconnection] for details](https://docs.zegocloud.com/faq/reconnect?product=ExpressVideo&platform=all).

   * When to trigger:
   *   1. When the user logs in to the room for the first time, if there are other users in the room, the SDK will trigger a callback notification with `updateType` being [ZegoUpdateTypeAdd], and `userList` is the other users in the room at this time.
